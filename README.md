# CS255-System-Analysis

1 Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a new client who saw there a need to provide support to new drivers as they apply for their diver's license. They noticed that there was little support to help prepare new driver's for their test. They hoped to create a system that would allow inviduals to prepare through online resources, online tests, and live in person driving lessons. They were looking for a system that would facilitate those three objectives while also managing reservations and managing lesson packages available to clients.

2 What did you do particularly well?

I thought that my Business Requirements document was thorough in how it would fulfill DriverPass' expectations. I also hope that it was easy to read, especially for a non technical audience. I believe they would be able to look at that document and get a good grasp of the features that would be available in DriverPass.

3 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
I would definitely choose my UML case diagram. I do not feel that my current knowledge allows me to create the best version of that document. To improve it, I would spend a good deal of time increasing my knowledge of how to create an effective and readable case diagram. I would also make a greater effort to collaborate with other more experienced individuals to get their perspective and advice on crafting the diagram.

4 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Envisioning what the user expects an action to accomplish, I believe, its the most important when creating a system. Obviously, back end details are important and need consideration but focus first should be on how the user will interact with the system. This focus would be critical when converting those needs into techinical details. Using user centric language in documents helps accomplish. For instance using phrase like 'As a user.' To reiterate too, the system is being designed for the user not for the developer. So while something may be preferable to use as designers and developers, it does not mean it is in the best interest of the user or client. Keeping our design mentality aligned with a user's needs ensures we design an ideal product.

5 How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software is to start with simple and build to the complicated. Rather then moving in a linear fashion through the system, building in complexity throughout the process means that it is easier to find and fix mistakes. This prevents moments that would demand a major rebuild over something that could have been preventable. 

One technique that I will use with more frequency, even when not necessarily required, is the designing of various UML diagrams. Even if not needed, it really helps you create the right mindset for development and can also help show possible issues that could arise while developing the system. It can also help you see areas where your system might need further development or refinement.
